## Tip  22 : Callable Class

In flutter we can call instance of a class like we call method.

What you have to do is defile a `call()` method of any return type or arguments. that `call()` method will be called when you call the instance.

```dart
void main() {
    var member = CallableClass();
    member("Flutter");    
}

class CallableClass{
    call(String name){
        print("Name is $name");
    }
}
```
