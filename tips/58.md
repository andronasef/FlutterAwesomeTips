## Tip  58 : Easy Flutter installation

Still confused installing flutter in mac/linux easily?

1. Download Flutter zip.
2. Decompress it in desired directory.
3. `cd` to that desired directory from terminal.
      [🚨⚠️ flutter should be inside desired directory]
4. Run the following command  
```bash
# If you are using zsh:
echo "\nexport PATH="\$PATH:`pwd`/flutter/bin"">>~/.zshrc ; source ~/.zshrc

# If you are using bash:
echo "\nexport PATH="\$PATH:`pwd`/flutter/bin"">>~/.bashrc ; source ~/.bashrc
```
