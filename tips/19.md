## Tip  19 : Amazing Library `time.dart`

If you are tired to long and verbose DateTime and Duration calculation `time.dart` comes to your rescue.

```dart
//Before
var 3dayLater = DateTime.now().add(Duration(days: 3)).day;

//After
var 3dayLater = 3.days.fromNow.day;

//Before
var duration = Duration(minutes: 10) +Duration(seconds: 15) 
  - Duration(minutes: 3) + Duration(hours: 2;

//After
var duration = 10.minutes + 15.seconds - 3.minutes + 2.hours;

//Before
await  Future.delayed(Duration(seconds: 2))

//After
await 2.seconds.delay
```
