## Tip  42 : Flutter ShapeBorder

We can use ShapeBorder to give outline to widgets or Clip them on it's shape. There are my ShapeBorder like `Border, ContinuousRectangleBorder, StadiumBorder, CircleBorder, BeveledRectangleBorder` etc.

1. Use ShapeBorder to give a Widget outline.
```dart
Container(
    decoration: ShapeDecoration(
        color: Colors.white,
        shape: // Any shape border
    ),
)
```
2. Use ShapeBorder to clip a Widget.
```dart
ClipPath(
    clipper: ShapeBorderClipper(
        shape: // Any shape border
    ),
    child: // Any Child to be clipped
)
```
