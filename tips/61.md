## Tip  61 : Using Flare Animations

Similar to vector graphics, Flutter doesn't support vector animation natively. [Rive (rive.app)](https://rive.app/explore) helps with amazing vector animations in Flutter.

1. Add flare in `pubspec.yaml`:
```yaml
flare_flutter: ^version
```

2. Download flare files from [rive.app](https://rive.app/explore) & put those `.flr` files into 
```yaml
`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/erluxman/awesomefluttertips/master/assets/` folder:

        assets:
            - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/erluxman/awesomefluttertips/master/assets/
```
3. Start using `FlareActor` widget.
```dart
FlareActor(
        "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/erluxman/awesomefluttertips/master/assets/world.flr",

        //ðŸš¨CautionðŸš¨, you can find ðŸ‘‰ #animation name in
        //left bottom ðŸ‘ˆðŸ‘‡ of rive.app designer tool when
        //Animation tab is selected
            
        animation: "world")
```
