## Tip   44 : Collection if & for

If you logically decide wheather to add a particular item into collection or not? It looks like no big deal when we dealing with adding normal objects to a collection as we could simply add collection items inside if or for statement.

But if we want to conditionally add widget or list of them inside another as one as it's children, it's a pain.

From dart 2.3 onwards, we can use `collection if` and `collection for` operators for adding items to a collection `conditionally` or `in bulk`.

### **Without collection if  or collection for**

```dart
ListView(
    children: [
        Title(news.headline),      
        (news.cover != null) ? FeatureImage(news.cover) : Container(),
        ...news.paragraphs.map((paragraph) => Paragraph(paragraph)).toList(),
        (news.author != null) ? Authored(news.author) : Container(),
        Row(
           mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
            children: [
                (selected > 0) ? nextButton() : Container(),
                (selected < (allNews.length - 1)) ? prevButton() : Container(),
            ],
        )
    ],
)
```
### **With collection if  or collection for**
```dart
ListView(
    children: [
        Title(news.headline),
        if (news.cover != null) FeatureImage(news.cover),
        for (var paragraph in news.paragraphs) Paragraph(paragraph),
        if (news.author != null) Authored(news.author),
        Row(
            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
            children: [
                if (selected > 0) nextButton(),
                if (selected < (allNews.length - 1)) prevButton(),
            ],
        )
    ],
)
```
