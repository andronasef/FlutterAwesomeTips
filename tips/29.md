## Tip  29 : Wrap widget

When you are making responsive UIs, you need to wrap contents dynamically.

Wrap comes to the rescue. Wrap is like Column/Row but wraps it's children to next row or column.

Use Wrap like you use Column or Row just give it's direction (either vertical or horizontal)

    Wrap(
        direction: Axis.vertical/Axis.horizontal,
        children: [Widgets],
        runAlignment: WrapAlignment.start,
        spacing: 20, //space between previous and next item
        runSpacing: 20, //space between new row or column
        );
