## Tip  16 : Bulk declaration

If you have been declaring each member separately all the time, you can declare members of same types at once.

I wouldn't declare `age` and `shoeSize` at once because they are not related.

With great power comes great responsibility, Use this wisely.

```dart
class Footballer {

  String firstName = "Lionel";
  String middleName = "Andrés";
  String lastName = "Messi";

  double weightKG;
  double heightCM;

  int goals;
  int assists;
  int tackles;
  int takeons;
  int saves;
  int shots;
}

// The class above can be replaced with:
class Footballer {

  String firstName = "Lionel", middleName = "Andrés", lastName = "Messi";

  double weightKG, heightCM;

  int goals, assists, tackles, takeons, saves, shots;
}
```
