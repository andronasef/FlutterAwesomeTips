dev_dependencies:
  flutter_launcher_icons: ^0.7.5
```

 2. Configure flutter_icons (**`no spaces before flutter_icons:`**)

```yml
flutter_icons:
  android: "launcher_icon"
  ios: true
  image_path: "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/erluxman/awesomefluttertips/master/assets/images/ic_launcher.png" #use your image path
```

3. Generate Icons

```shell
flutter pub run flutter_launcher_icons:main
```

4. Run app
