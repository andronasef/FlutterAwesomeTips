## Tip  14 : FractionallySizedBox

Ever wanted the widget to have height and width exactly in the same proportion to it's screen's height and width?

FractionallySizedBox is build exactly for that use case. Just give it the fraction you need for your height and width and it will handle everything else. The fraction value will range between 0.0 to 1.0

```dart
FractionallySizedBox(
  widthFactor: 0.5,
  heightFactor: 0.5,
  child: Container(color: Colors.green),
)
```
