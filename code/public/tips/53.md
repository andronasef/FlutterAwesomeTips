## Tip  53 : final vs const

`final and const` in dart are confusing to the level we think both of them are same. Let's see their diffrences

| ___`final`___ (global / static / member variables)                                                                                                                                                                 | ___`const`___ (static / global variables)                                                                                                 |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Has single value of a `member or static or global variable` from start to end.                                                                                                                                     | Has single value of a `static or global variable` from start to end.                                                                      |
| Different objects of same type can have different final values in same member varaible.                                                                                                                            | Different objects of same type cannot have different const values in same varaible. (i.e. `const members should be static`)               |
| Should be initialzed `before constructor is called`.                                                                                                                                                               | Should be `strictly initialized during declaration`.                                                                                      |
| Only the `final` declared `member/staic/global variable` objects are immutable, their content variables may not. i.e. variables inside final objects can be udpated / reassigned if they are not final themselves. | All `const` declared `Golbal/static` variable objects including all their internal content varibales are immutable and cannot be changed. |
| Can be `intialized` with `immutable/ mutable / calculated values` determined at  `compile time or runtime`.                                                                                                        | Can be `initialized`  with `only immutable values` with all their immutable internal varaibles, determined at `compile time`.             |

We can take example of various computers and how they can be compared with dart modifiers.
