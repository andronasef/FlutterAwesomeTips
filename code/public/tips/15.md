## Tip  15 : Flexible vs Expanded

Expanded() is nothing more than Flexible() with

```dart
Flexible (fit: FlexFit.tight) = Expanded()
```

but, Flexible uses `fit :FlexFit.loose` by default.

**FlexFit.tight** = Wants to fit tight into parent taking as much space as possible.

**FlexFit.loose** = Wants to fit loose into parent taking as little space as possible for itself.

**flex** = The factor of space taken from parent. Mostly not fully used if `flex: FlexFit.loose` used i.e. `Flexible`.

If you fully read the following image, you will fully understand the difference between `Flexible` and `Expanded`

```dart
class Flexible extends... {
  /// The flex factor to use for this child
  ///
  /// If null or zero, the child is inflexible and determines its own size. If
  /// non-zero, the amount of space the child's can occupy in the main axis is
  /// determined by dividing the free space (after placing the inflexible
  /// children) according to the flex factors of the flexible children.
  final int flex;

  /// How a flexible child is inscribed into the available space.
  ///
  /// If [flex] is non-zero, the [fit] determines whether the child fills the
  /// space the parent makes available during layout. If the fit is
  /// [FlexFit.tight], the child is required to fill the available space. If the
  /// fit is [FlexFit.loose], the child can be at most as large as the available
  /// space (but is allowed to be smaller).
  final FlexFit fit;

  ........
}

class Expanded extends Flexible {
  /// Creates a widget that expands a child of a [Row], [Column], or [Flex]
  /// so that the child fills the available space along the flex widget's
  /// main axis.
  const Expanded({
    Key key,
    int flex = 1,
    @required Widget child,
  }) : super(key: key, flex: flex, fit: FlexFit.tight, child: child);
}
```
