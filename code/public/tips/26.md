## Tip  26 : Hero Animation (Shared Element Transition)

### **Do you want your Widget/Image to fly from one screen to another?**

Flutter makes it super easy to do **Shared Element / Hero animation** with Widget called `Hero`.
Just give **same `tag`** for the `Hero` widget in both screen and your Widget will start flying from one screen to another.

Caution : Do not give a static string as tag if your UI has dynamic data like List, use a value of object like title,id etc as tag

```dart
//First Screen

FirstPageWidget extends StatelessWidget{
    return Scaffold(
        ...
        Hero(
            tag: player.name
            child: Image.network(url)
        )
        //Other player List
        ...
        );
}

//Second Page

SecondPageWidget extends StatelessWidget{
    return Scaffold(
        ...
        Hero(
            tag: player.name
            child: Image.network(url)
            )
        //Player details
        ...
        );
}
```
