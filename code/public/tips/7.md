## Tip  7 : Spacer Widget

Using Container with certain height/width to create responsive space between Widgets? That may look good on one screen but will not look the same in different screen size.

Spacer Widget comes for the rescue. Instead of `Container(width: / height: )`, use `Spacer(flex: )`.

How on this earth did I not know about this widget earlier? This is going to save many lives ðŸ˜‚
