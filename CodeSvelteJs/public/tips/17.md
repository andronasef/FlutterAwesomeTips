## Tip  17 : SliverAppBar / Collapsable AppBar / ParallaxHeader

Remember CollapsableAppBar (android) / ParallaxHeader (ios)? We have SliverAppBar in Flutter to do exactly that.

To use it, you will have to have a CustomScrollView as parent.

then you add two slivers of it.

1. SliverAppBar
2. SliverFillRemaining

You can play with values of snap, floating, pinned etc to get desired effect
