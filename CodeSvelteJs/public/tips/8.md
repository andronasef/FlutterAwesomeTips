## Tip  8 : ListView.separated()

If you have you been adding `Container()` with `maxwidth` at the bottom of `ListItem` to put divider line like me, you have been doing it wrong all the time.

Flutter has `ListView.separated` just for that purpose. We have to also provide `separatorBuilder` in addition to what we already passed while using `ListView.builder`

**Bonus 🍾🎁🎊🎉 : You do not have to check if the item is last in order not to draw divider after the last item.**

[try in dartpad](https://dartpad.dartlang.org/31ec967b140ac6a5795c38ea4bdfd9a2)

```dart
ListView.separated(
  itemCount: 25,
  separatorBuilder: (BuildContext context, int index) => Divider(
    thickness: 1,
  ),
  itemBuilder: (BuildContext context, int index) {
    return ListTile(
      title: Text(
        'Index Number $index',
      ),
    );
  },
);
```
