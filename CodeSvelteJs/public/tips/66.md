## Tip  66 : assert(boolean,messageIfFalse)

If some `conditions` __`must not ever occur`__ on program, we use assert to halt the execution.

Assert condition means that there is no way we can handle exception caused if the condition fails, it must be fixed.

`assert()` statement also help reduce the responsibility of a program as it doesn't need to handle every edge cases.

`assert()` are ignored in release/production.

Some examples :

```dart
updateUser(User user){
        assert(user.id != null) // There is no way to udpate user without id.
        syncUser(user);
}

int  getRealSquareRoot(int square){
        assert(square >= 0) //square must be positive to have real root.
        return sqrt(square);
}

driveCar(Car car){
        assert(car.hasEngine);
        assert(car.hasFuel);
        assert(car.hasWheels);
        car.drive();
}
```
