## Tip  10 : Relative Import : the right way to import `.dart` files we have in our lib package

Ever wondered what is the right way to import a file in your own package?

Prefer relative imports to absolute imports.

Why?

- It's shorter and cleaner.
- We can easily differentiate our files and third-party ones.
- It makes sense, doesn't it?

```
my_package
└─ lib
   ├─ src
   │  └─ utils.dart
   └─ api.dart
```
If `api.dart` wants to import `utils.dart`, it should do so using:
```dart
import 'src/utils.dart';
```

And not:
```dart
import 'package:my_package/src/utils.dart';
```
